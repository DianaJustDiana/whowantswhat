## WhoWantsWhat?

My project is a website called WhoWantsWhat. It’s for people who are downsizing and want to give away their excess possessions -- from ho-hum to heirloom -- to family members. Specifically, I’m thinking of seniors who want to give their adult children (and grandchildren) in far-flung places the opportunity to call dibs on the items they’d like to have. There’s no need for everyone to gather at Grandma and Grandpa’s house in person; this app will allow everyone to view photos and descriptions online. Think of a by-invitation-only OfferUp or Craigslist where users can “like” items.

Technologies:

* Python
* Django
* PostgreSQL
* something TBA that allows users to upload photos
* someplace TBA (AWS S3? Google Cloud?) for storage of photos
* someplace TBA (Heroku? Google Cloud? PythonAnywhere?) for site hosting
